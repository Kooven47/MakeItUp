# Make It Up
*CAP4053 - AI for Game Programming*

## Story
There is a janitor working at a hotel, when some sort of drug gets applied to him. He starts to envision that all the furniture in the hotel he has treated very sloppily over the years are all attacking him. He goes through the levels, which are floors of the hotel, platforming and defeating this swarm of humanized hotel props (from his perspective), trying to save and warn his boss. These rooms could include a recreation room, restaurant, boiler room, pool, etc. At the end on the top floor, you finally discover whoâ€™s behind it all, your boss! You try to quit but end up having to fight the final boss!

## Core Gameplay Loop
* Enter a level which will either be:
  * Defeat all enemies
  * Survive for a set period of time
  * Run away (chase sequence)
  * Boss battle
* Use your killing and platforming skills to complete the objective
* Find weapons or upgrades to promote progression, dropped by enemies randomly with a low chance or upon completing a level with a high chance
  * Better drops as progression happens
* Move on to the next level by entering the elevator

## Visuals / Audio
The visuals are 16-bit, lighthearted, and vibrant to go with the story. Characters, enemies, weapons, and upgrades will be made by the artists while backgrounds, UI elements, and platforming elements will use pre-made art from Unity and Itch.IO
<br> The audio is 8-bit, generated from https://sfxr.me/ or acquired from the Unity story.

## Inspirations
* Luigi's Mansion
* Death Road to Canada
* My Friend Pedro
* Hollow Knight
* Enter the Gungeon
